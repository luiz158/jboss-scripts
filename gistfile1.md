Steps to run Forge (complete instructions - just 5 steps):

1. Download and Unzip the distribution into a folder (like where you put maven.)
2. Run `bin/forge` (unix) or `bin/forge.bat` (windows)
3. Create a new Project with JPA
    new-project --named example --topLevelPackage com.example
4. 
    beans setup
5. 
    beans new-bean 

From there you should have a good starting point for live demos with CDI. You can also do this using the JBoss Tools M3 release from within JBT.
